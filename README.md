Have fun practicing JavaScript and coding by solving enjoyable beginner-friendly exercises. These exercises are designed for people who are new to programming and those who have reached an intermediate level. If you're just starting out in programming, begin with these challenges. By working on them, you'll become a skilled programmer in a short time.

If programming is entirely new to you, it's a good idea to grasp some programming basics from the recommended resources. Once you've got the basics down, you can start tackling these problems. Remember to keep learning, solving problems, and working on projects as you continue your programming journey.

The challenges range from very easy to intermediate difficulty, and there are even a few semi-advanced problems. If you're unable to solve a problem on your own, you can take a look at my solution or seek assistance elsewhere. Then, give it another shot on your own. Enjoy the process of coding :)
